# INST_consolidation_project1
This code only runs for one player

1. The game will welcome the user with a message personalized to their name, after user inputs name of choice
2. from the categories of school, countries and fruits it will randomly choose a word
3. As a hint, it will automatically tell the user what category the random word is from
7. The user is not able to see the list of random words the program will choose from 
4. It will let the user know how many guesses they have
5. It will NOT let the user know what the word is
6. It will let the user know how many letters the word has

The user will be prompted to guess a letter that might be in that word
if incorrect: it will let them know and prompt them to try again
if correct: it will tell the user how many times the letter appears in the word
* but will not tell them WHERE
If the user guesses the correct final word, the code will congratulate them
Otherwise after three incorrect guesses the code will not allow the user to guess again.. instead it will inform them of what the correct word was 

   
* right now the code does not keep track of the letters guessed
* right now the code does not have a point system
