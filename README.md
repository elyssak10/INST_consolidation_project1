This code only runs for one player
run code in anaconda prompt?
â€¢	The object of the game is to guess a secret word from a bank of words split into three categories: school, countries, fruit
The program will choose one word randomly from these categories 

1. The game will welcome the user with a message personalized to their name, after user inputs name of choice
2. As a hint, it will automatically tell the user what category the random word is from
However, the user is not able to see the list of random words in each category and will not be able to see the random word
3. As an additional hint, it will tell the user how many letters are in that word
4. It will let the user know how many incorrect letter guesses/lives they have- 3 

The user will be prompted to guess a letter that might be in that word
if incorrect: it will let them know and prompt them to try again
if correct: it will tell the user how many times the letter appears in the word
* but will not tell them WHERE
If the user guesses the correct final word, the code will congratulate them
Otherwise after three incorrect letter guesses the code will not allow the user to guess again.. instead it will inform them of what the correct word was 

   
* right now the code does not keep track of the letters guessed
* right now the code does not have a point system
